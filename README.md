Dragonboat sorter app

The purpose of this app is to provide dragonboat teams with the ability to create seating arrangements based on paddler preferences, weights, and power.  I'm also trying to use this app to learn Backbone and D3.js.

Phase 1 - boat balancing

* learn javascript MVC
* left/right balance
* steerer/drummer weights?
* front/middle/back balance
*  weight distribution?
* power distribution curve 
  *  calculate total weight... hull speed(?)
  *  need to enter boat type?  
* shareable.  savable?
  * firebase?
